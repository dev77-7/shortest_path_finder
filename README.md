Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes of the graph.It uses a greedy approach to solve the problem and find the best solution.   
The algorithm works by building a set of nodes that have a minimum distance from the source.
The algorithm creates the tree of the shortest paths from the starting source vertex from all other points in the graph.   
It differs from the minimum spanning tree as the shortest distance between two vertices may not be included in all the vertices of the graph.
