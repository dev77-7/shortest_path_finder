Algorithm for Dijkstraâ€™s in C++ :-

[Steps to follow:]
1. First of all, we will mark all vertex as unvisited vertex.
2. Then, we will mark the source vertex as 0 and all other vertex as infinity.
3. Consider source vertex as current vertex.
4. Calculate the path length of all the neighboring vertex from the current vertex by adding the weight of the edge in the current vertex.
5. Now, if the new path length is smaller than the previous path length then replace it otherwise ignore it.
6. Mark the current vertex as visited after visiting the neighbour vertex of current vertex.
7. Select the vertex with the smallest path length as the new current vertex and go back to step 4.
8. Repeat this process until all the vertex are marked as visited.

Once we go through the algorithm, we can backtrack the source vertex and find our shortest path.
